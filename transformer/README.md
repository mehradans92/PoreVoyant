MOFormer_modded has been taken from this paper: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c11420.

Pretraining done on BW20K dataset. SMILES for those have been generated independently. Finetuned weights for the transformer on band gap is too large to be uploaded here. Please contact Sartaaj Khan for the finetuned weights.
